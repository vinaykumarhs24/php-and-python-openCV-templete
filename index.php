	  <h2>Simple Face Detection System Using Python OpenCV and PHP Web Interface</h2>
        <p>This project is a basic yet efficient face detection system built using Python's OpenCV library, with a web-based interface powered by PHP. The system offers a streamlined solution for detecting faces in images or real-time video without opening additional OpenCV windows when executed.</p>

        <h2>Key Features Include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Design:</strong> The project focuses on simplicity, making it easy to use and integrate into other systems without unnecessary complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Python and OpenCV for Face Detection:</strong> The core functionality is built using Python, utilizing the OpenCV library for its robust and well-documented face detection capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>PHP Web Interface:</strong> Users can interact with the system through a PHP-based web interface, which provides easy navigation and a user-friendly way to view and manage the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Language Integration:</strong> The project demonstrates seamless communication between different programming languages (Python and PHP), embedding Python's face detection functionality into a PHP web environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Information:</strong> The PHP web interface allows users to navigate through different sections and gather information, providing flexibility in terms of what can be viewed and how the results are presented.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This project serves as an excellent demonstration of integrating face detection with a web platform, making it both practical and extensible for further development or customization.</p>
