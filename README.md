# Face Detection System using Python OpenCV and PHP

This project integrates a simple face detection system using Python's OpenCV and a web interface powered by PHP. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to execute, demonstrating the seamless integration between Python for face detection and PHP for the web interface.

It is also an explanation for organizing the file structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PHP (any version supporting `php -S`)
- OpenCV for Python
- Flask for Python (to handle the web server in Python)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install PHP

To get started, ensure that PHP is installed on your system. You can download PHP from [here](https://www.php.net/downloads) or use your system's package manager.

### 2. Run PHP Web Server
